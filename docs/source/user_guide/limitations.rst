Limitations

Analyses
--------

|name| is currently only capable to perform *static* aeroelastic analyses. Static phenomena such as static wing deformations, divergence and control reversal can be analysed. Any dynamic phenomena such as classical flutter are out of the scope of |name|, although it is planned to add the capability to perform *dynamic* analyses as well.

.. note::

    Any contributions/help on this issue are welcome (see also :ref:`sec_contributing`).
