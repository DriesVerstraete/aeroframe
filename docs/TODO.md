# TODO

## Important
* Data exchange can be made "in-memory" instead of through files
    * Make `SharedState()` class (contains deformation and loads, etc.)

## Testing
* ...

## Documentation
* ...

## Ideas
* Use a "master model" class for geometry?
* Aeroelastic sizing loop? Similar to Seywald

## Obtaining input data
* How can equivalent beam properties be extracted/derived from CPACS
    * Perhaps "Seywalds flight manoeuvre" sizing loop necessary
